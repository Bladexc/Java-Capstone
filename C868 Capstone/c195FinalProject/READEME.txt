CUSTOM REPORT PER SECTION A.3.F:
I stuck with a simple report that will filter all appointments per customer. 
Similair to the report, "Schedule per Contact", this report allows the business
to easily locate any appointments a specific customer may have.  

If an employee wishes to get more information about their customer's activity, they 
can utilize this report. 

Both reports include feedback when no appointments are found per the selected customer/contact.
