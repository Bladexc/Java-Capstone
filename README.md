This project demonstrates my Java, JavaFX, and SQL knowledge to create an application with a graphical interface that manages appointment and customer data for a small business. 

The application utilizes a SQL API to communicate with a local database to store data used within the application.

Please feel free to go ahead and explore my project files and identify my coding style.  I leave comments with the intention that my teammates will be able to understand what each segment of the codebase is doing.
